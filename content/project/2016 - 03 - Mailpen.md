Description: "Final graduation project of my apprenticeship in software development. Planning, building and documenting a newsletter delivery service. Split into two complete separate parts: frontend and backend. The admin interface is built with AngularJS as an onepage app. The backend provides an API (used by frontend) making it easy for other developers to integrate in their custom solutions."
